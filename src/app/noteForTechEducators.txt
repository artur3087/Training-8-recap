Is it actually ok to write notes here?
---------------------------------------

I have not finished my project for this week. 
However: I have posted this code, which I work on, because I know that it meets at least 1 requirement from assignment of week 9.

Originally it was a recap page for week 8 and week 9 and it did not meant to be assignment work for week 9 but I am running
out of time more often due to a fact that I need to work for DELIVEROO in a weekends, plus my internet plays up recently, which slows me even more.
---------------------------------------

this work?
I believe that it is a solid base for future developments - making more features, functionality and appearance. 
Thus: I will continue improving this page. 

----------------------------------------

In globals css I used a picture for a background for: .cl-card:
/* background-image: url(./photos/The-Big-Lebowski-hp-GQ-25Feb16_rex_b.webp); */

This was commented out to make all the letters more visible for you, instead I adopted a blue background color for sign in page.
I had to do it because there is much more further work on styling this page. 


----------------------------------------

FUNCTIONALITY I created so far:

App is able to: 
1. log in/out a user and for him to create his username. 
2. It shows array of objects with rules for this page - simple hardcoded array in home page.
3. It shows dude's past posts, which are array of objects called from sql database. App is connected to vercel sql database. 
4. After logging in user can add his posts in 'WRITE A POST PAGE'. This page is connected to database with posts and comments tables.
5. User can edit his post. 
6. User can comment under the post and edit this comment. 
7. User will not see posts if he is not logged in. 
8. User's idea, after logging in, can be seen in vercel database.
9. Favicon is used to show icon of a 'dude' on every page.


-----------------------------------------

CONCERNS: 
1. I tested this app on mobile phone and it is not possible to use Clerk via android system for some reason. 
    I have tried to log in via mobile phone and on click at 'sign in' button and 'make a post', NOTHING HAPPENS.
    I DO NOT KNOW how to fix that problem.
